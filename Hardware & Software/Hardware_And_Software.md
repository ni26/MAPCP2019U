# Hardware and Software  
The way hardware and software work comes down to the simple idea of voltage. We can think of it as a switch being made  
on and off and as a result the light bulb involved gets turned on and off as well. Different parts of a computer are   
supplied with different amount of voltage which results in those different parts getting activated at different times.  
The sequence of these operations all comes down to the OS of the computer.   
It is also my understanding that the code that we write which ultimately is translated into 0's 1's makes a sequence of charges that causes the "switch" to get  
on and off. This part still sounded vague to me as to how do we actually tell electrons if they are supposed to be there or not.  
It is also my understanding that the magnetic domains are at play as well. Namely, when we write a code and it translates into those 0's and 1's, the magnetic domains would   
help us to for example see the message on the screen of the computer.   
Another anology that I found to be interesting was the 'telephone' analogy. All phones are connected to each other at all times, but only   
after dialing a specific number two specific phones are connected to each other. In terms of computer language, the CPU would be the one   
that makes those connections to different parts of a computer.   
Each part has its own number, CPU calls that number, and only that part gets activated. Apparently the number that the CUP has to dial, and the data the   
CPU sends to each part, is what is different from machine to machine (meaning, it is hardware Dependant.)   
What is still not clear to me though is that, how those 'data' are stored and sent? How the 'call' or 'not call' a specific part of a computer   
is done?
